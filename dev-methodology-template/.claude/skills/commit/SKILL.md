## Usage

```
/commit [message]
/commit closes #17
/commit fixes #23 - added validation
```

## Process

### Step 1: Check Status

```bash
git status
git diff --stat
```

### Step 2: Stage Changes

Stage specific files (avoid `.env`, credentials):
```bash
git add <files>
```

### Step 3: Commit with Issue Reference

Include issue reference in commit message when applicable:
- `Closes #N` - closes issue when merged
- `Fixes #N` - closes issue (for bugs)
- `Refs #N` - references without closing

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>: <description>

<optional body>

Closes #N

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### Step 4: Push

```bash
git push
```

### Step 5: Update Issue Status

Move issue to "Review" state per SDLC workflow:
```bash
# Remove in-progress label, add review label
gh issue edit <N> --remove-label "status-in-progress" --add-label "status-review"

# Verify
gh issue view <N> --json state,title,labels
```

Note: Only applies when issue was in `status-in-progress`. Skip if no issue reference.
